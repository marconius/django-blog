This is a blog for Django projects.

Requirements::

* filebrowser or filebrowse-no-grappelli: http://readthedocs.org/docs/django-filebrowser/en/latest/quickstart.html)

Principal Ideas/Goals Behind Project:
* Takes basic-apps' blog a little closer to Wordpress, without overbloat
* Easy installation ( installs with TinyMce and filebrowser already configured
* Very little or no logic in templates
* Makes easy to use and intuitive sites that can be used as substitutes for walls and spaces on the popular social networking sites
