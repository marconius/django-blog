This is a blog for Django projects.

Requirements::

Principal Ideas/Goals Behind Project::

* Takes basic-apps' blog a little closer to Wordpress, without overbloat
* Easy installation ( installs with TinyMce and filebrowser already configured
* Very little or no logic in templates
* Makes easy to use and intuitive sites that can be used as substitutes for walls and spaces on the popular social networking sites
